This is a simple chat app called Chattr, developed with React Native.
It is using Firebase for authentication and storing messages.
The chat functionality is implemented using the package react-native-gifted-chat. 
App is still a work in progress, future iterations should have multiple chat sessions. 
Android part is the only part working at the moment!
Use the facebook login, as google is not working at the moment.
